# Welcome to GBA Run
This is basically a bootleg version of subway surfers. Without any powerups, you can only move left or right.
# Instructions
There is no win condition, you must get the highest score possible. 

There are three different types of obstacles/items you can interact with:
- RED OBSTACLE: you can bypass this block by holding down the 'B' button on GBA
- MAGENTA OBSTACLE: you can also bypass this block by holding down the 'A' button on the GBA
- WHITE OBSTACLE: these are not bypassable and you must avoid them or you die.
- YELLOW PARTICLE: Congrats! This is the powerup and it removes any debuffs and lets you move vertically.
- GREY OBSTACLE: this obstacle is a field where you lose the ability to turn colors, making the game harder.

Your score is based on the amount of time spent alive, and can be increased by spending time bypassing red/magenta blocks.
